    <h2>General Suggestions for Qianye's board Game</h2>
    <div>Hi @Qianye
        <p>Though I don't know what kind of board games you're going to make, and I guess you probably had a draft in your mind. I still have sorted some thoughts of mine about the board game design. I hope they could be helpful to you.</p>
        <p>I don't have too much playing experience about board games. (I'm not a 'people person') But some of them are really fun and worthy to notice. (I like games and the fun essence of any kinds of games are my prey.)</p>
        <p>According to my observations, I think the board games could be divided into three main categories.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Story borad game</strong></li>
            <p>The first one stands for the story which is also my favorite one. There are tons of storytelling board games. The most famous one must be the Dragon and Dungeon series. TRPG is how we call it. Players could play a role and cultivate the character and interact with both others and the game world itself. This kind of board requires more about the background story design but also depends on the logic part a lot. I think the word 'freedom' is the meaning of DND. Not only the freedom of acting as an imaginary character but also the freedom of imagination (You could describe things through words and let players imagine how that world looks like.)</p>
            <p>There is also another board game involves story part. Something like the 'Mysterium'. You could find this game on amazon.com. (and many of the same kind of games but in the different genres.) This kind of board game gives players roles and a completed story. Players interact and try to reveal the truth or explore the outer space! It's more limited on 'freedom' but which means you need deal less about how the entire world works instead of only focusing on the story itself. (But this kind of game requires some physical items as 'objects' to make the story more vivid. It's better to do some artworks and make some interesting but small widgets to make your game attracting!)</p>
            <li><strong>Traditional Strategy Game</strong></li>
            <p>The second genre is more about logic and mechanics. So many classic card games, even Mahjong, Rummikub, Hanafuda, different chess games, go game, and Monopoly. I would recommend a new but popular one, the Exploding Kittens. Exploding Kittens probably was one of the most popular board games/party games in the last year. It even got an app on IOS that you could play with it for free. (I also have the physical cards I could bring them to meetings if you want to try to play it.) This kind of game is about only one thing, that's the strategy.</p>
            <p>Thinking, thinking, and thinking. You cannot have any flaws or pitfalls in the rule part of this kind of game. If you are going to make this kind of game, I recommend two things. Firstly, get your logic knowledge fully prepared. (I have a copy of Attacking Faulty Reasoning(7th edition) if you want to take a look I could also bring it to the meeting.) Secondly, testing, testing, and testing. Find different groups of people to test your games, collect their feedbacks and try to figure out how to make it grow. To be honest, to design a strategy game is even more difficult than (or at least equally difficult) writing a program. A program always could do something (if the debugging part is completed perfectly), but a strategy game is about making a sequence of the logic chains, and more important, to make them FUN!</p>
            <li><strong>Interaction Game</strong></li>
            <p>The last genre I want to talk about is the interactive game. Some games like Draw Something, Charades, or Truth or Dare. It doesn't require you to make a set of rule or story elaborately. But in the physical games that I ever get in touch with, they either have to attract art style or have interesting instructions. ('Cards Against Humanity' also counts in this kind though I think that game is really horrible,jk lol) This kind of game provides fun through players' interaction. Compare with designing a fantasy world or drilling into the logic, the interactive games need you to know about human. What makes them happy and laugh, what makes them scared and suspect. What things they think are funny? It's like to answer a question that why is a joke is a joke.</p>
            <p>It's impractical to study human psychology in such a short time period. But you could absolutely read some related paper. And, play some interactive games with your friends, many of them, compare each one, how they are different and which one you think it's better. Also, watch some game TV shows would be helpful.</p>
        </ol>

        <p>That's all I've thought about designing a board game. I may have some misexplained concepts here since like I said (I don't really have that many friends that I could play board games with them, poor me, jk) I rarely play board games. If I made any mistakes, @Jay Taylor-Laird please help to point it out! Thanks.</p>
        <p>The three categories definitions are my personal understanding. You would not find something similar to it online. But it's always good to search helpful resources.</p>
        <p>If you need any further help, I'd like to offer a hand.</p>

        <p>Regards,<br>
